        Our website allows for mainly high school students, 
        but works for any students in general to input their 
        grades and the website would calculate the final grade. 
        This website tackles a social justice issue. This issue is education. 
        This website will give the grade that a person has earned 
        through the calculations. Also, an additional feature our 
        website offers is a budget calculator that we highly recommend 
        to high school students with financial difficulties or 
        especially college students. The calculator would 
        calculate how much students should use and organize 
        on how much they currently have.
